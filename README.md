# HEXAGON
HEXAGON is an open hardwrae development board built around 480 MHz Renesas MCU (Arm® Cortex®-M85 core with HeliumTM).<br/>
The board was designed as there was nothing similar meeting our demands at the moment.<br/>
Along with Cortex®-M85 in BGA package the hardware design also includes:<br/>
✔ 8 MB SDRAM<br/>
✔ 32 MB QSPI<br/>
✔ Stereo Audio Codec (for voice recognition aaplications development) with 3.5mm jack connector for headphones and microphone<br/>
✔ USB interface with USB-C connector (MCU USB and/or power)<br/>
✔ Ethernet interface with RJ45<br/>
✔ CAN interface with D-SUB connector<br/>
✔ RS485 interface with D-SUB connector<br/>
✔ Flexible power supply (from 5 to 30VDC) with barrel jack connector and an option to power the board from USB<br/>
✔ Reset button and power supply LEDs<br/>
✔ 2 user buttons and 3 user LEDs<br/>
